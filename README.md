# Detection of ships on satellite images using YOLO v2 deep learning
This MATLAB example demonstrates how to extract useful information from satellite images using a simple deep learning based ship detector, which can be included in a broad range of situational awareness sensors of maritime autonomous surface ships.

1. Download MATLAB LiveScript "YOLO_ship_detector.mlx" and data "data.zip"

3. Download MATLAB Add-On with a pretrained Deep Learning Toolbox Model for ResNet-50 Network
    https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64626-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-resnet-50-network
    
4. Unzip "data.zip" containing train and test images, and image labelling session data
 
5. Run "YOLO_ship_detector.mlx" (change LiveScript parameter "doTraining" to train the model)
